# G1GC Options
# -XX:+UseG1GC                           # Enable G1 Garbage Collector
# -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200               # Target max GC pause time (ms)
# -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16m               # Size of G1 regions (1MB-32MB, power of 2)
# -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=45  # Start marking cycle when heap is 45% full
# -XX:G1ReservePercent=10                # Reserve 10% of heap to reduce promotion failures
# -XX:ParallelGCThreads=<nproc>          # Threads for parallel phases
# -XX:ConcGCThreads=<nproc/4>            # Threads for concurrent marking

# Tuning Tips:
#
# For Lower Latency:
#   - Decrease MaxGCPauseMillis (e.g., 50-100ms)
#   - Increase G1ReservePercent
#   - Increase InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent if heap is large
#
# For Higher Throughput:
#   - Increase MaxGCPauseMillis (e.g., 500ms)
#   - Increase heap size
#   - Use -XX:+UseStringDeduplication for string-heavy apps
#
# Monitoring:
#   - Check GC logs for pause times
#   - Monitor "to-space exhausted" events
#   - Watch for humongous allocations (>50% of region size)
